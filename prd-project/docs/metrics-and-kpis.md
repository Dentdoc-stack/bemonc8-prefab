# Metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

## Introduction
This document outlines the metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure the success of the Flooddashboard project. These metrics will help in assessing the effectiveness of the product and guiding future improvements.

## Metrics

1. **User Engagement**
   - **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: The number of unique users who interact with the dashboard on a daily basis.
   - **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**: The number of unique users who engage with the dashboard over a month.

2. **Data Processing Performance**
   - **Average Response Time**: The average time taken to process user queries and return results.
   - **Data Processing Throughput**: The number of data records processed per minute.

3. **Accuracy of Predictions**
   - **Prediction Accuracy Rate**: The percentage of correct predictions made by the AI models compared to actual outcomes.
   - **False Positive Rate**: The percentage of incorrect positive predictions made by the models.

4. **User Satisfaction**
   - **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: A measure of user satisfaction and loyalty based on survey responses.
   - **User Feedback Ratings**: Average ratings collected from user feedback forms.

5. **System Reliability**
   - **Uptime Percentage**: The percentage of time the system is operational and accessible to users.
   - **Error Rate**: The number of errors encountered per 1000 user interactions.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **KPI 1**: Achieve a DAU of at least 500 users within the first three months of launch.
- **KPI 2**: Maintain an average response time of under 2 seconds for user queries.
- **KPI 3**: Ensure a prediction accuracy rate of at least 85% for the AI models.
- **KPI 4**: Achieve an NPS of 50 or higher within the first six months.
- **KPI 5**: Maintain system uptime of 99.9% throughout the year.

## Conclusion
Tracking these metrics and KPIs will provide valuable insights into the performance and impact of the Flooddashboard project, enabling data-driven decisions for future enhancements.

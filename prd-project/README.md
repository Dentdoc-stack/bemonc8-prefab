# PRD Project

## Overview
The PRD Project is designed to develop a comprehensive AI studio that incorporates advanced calculation logic and filtering mechanisms to enhance data processing and analysis. This project aims to provide users with a robust platform for managing and interpreting data effectively.

## Features
- Detailed calculation logic for data processing
- Customizable filters and rules for data analysis
- User-friendly interface for interaction with the AI studio
- Comprehensive documentation for users and developers

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Dentdoc-stack/Flooddashboard.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Flooddashboard/prd-project
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:

   npm run build
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- Refer to the `docs` directory for detailed product requirements, user stories, use cases, metrics, and risk assessments.
- The `src/ai-studio` directory contains the core logic for calculations and filters. Review `calculation-logic.md` and `filters-and-rules.md` for implementation details.
- For insights into existing logic, consult `src/references/existing-logic-overview.md`.

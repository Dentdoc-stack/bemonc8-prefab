# Overview of Existing Logic

This document provides an overview of the existing calculation logic and filters that are relevant to the Flooddashboard project. The intention is to serve as a reference for implementing new features in the AI studio.

## Calculation Logic

The calculation logic is primarily defined in the `src/ai-studio/calculation-logic.md` file. It includes various algorithms and formulas that are essential for processing data effectively. Key components of the calculation logic include:

- **Data Aggregation**: Methods for aggregating data from multiple sources.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Techniques for performing statistical calculations on the data.
- **Data Transformation**: Rules for transforming raw data into a usable format.

## Filters and Rules

The filters and rules that govern data processing are detailed in the `src/ai-studio/filters-and-rules.md` file. These filters are crucial for ensuring that only relevant data is analyzed and presented. Important aspects include:

- **Criteria for Data Inclusion**: Specifications on what data should be included based on certain conditions.
- **Exclusion Rules**: Guidelines for excluding data that does not meet the necessary criteria.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Mechanisms for applying filters dynamically based on user input or other variables.

## Relevance to AI Studio

The existing logic outlined in this document is intended to be leveraged in the AI studio to enhance functionality and improve data analysis capabilities. By understanding the current logic, developers can create more efficient and effective features that align with the project's goals. 

## Conclusion

This overview serves as a foundational reference for developers working on the Flooddashboard project. It is essential to familiarize oneself with the existing logic to ensure consistency and coherence in the development of new features.
